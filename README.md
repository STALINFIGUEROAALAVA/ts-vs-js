# TypeScript vs JavaScript

Want to know what are the main differences between [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)? You can check yourself inside the `src` dir.

## Usage

_Note: You must have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Optionally you can have installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and use it to install the dependencies._

Clone this repo (and star it ⭐️):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cesalberca/ts-vs-js.git
```

CD into the project:

```shell
cd ts-vs-js
```

Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Compile it:

```shell
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

And run it:

```shell
npm run execute
# or
yarn execute
```

You can also have it recompile on save in another shell:

```shell
npm run watch
# or
yarn watch
```

_Note: It's recommended that you install the [Quokka extension](https://quokkajs.com/) in order to interact with the code more easily._
